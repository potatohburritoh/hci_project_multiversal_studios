# Multiversal Studios: UI Prototyping

## Objective
The meta-objective is to have computer science students think more broadly about "last-inch connectivity": the efficiency of information transfer between the users' minds and the computing interfaces. This includes developing awareness of the importance of usability, and having a keen perspective of the input-output interfacing between computers and human (input:senses, output:muscles). Other aspects of the course includes UI and UX design, prototyping, familiarity with human and machine capabilities, as well as analysis of underlying "protocols" when humans communicate with or manipulate interfaces.

## Coursework Assignment
The task is to design two iterations of a ficticious public kiosk at an amusement park (Multiversal Studios) that will help visitors plan their activities. The design has to follow ``"Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design"``. 

The coursework involves ``two versions of UI prototypes`` as follows: 
- Low-Fidelity Prototype
- High-Fidelity Prototype


## Knowledge Accquired: 

1.	Introduction to HCI
2.	Usability
3.	Guidelines, Principles, and Theory
4.	Prototyping and Evaluation
5.	Humans (sensing, perception, etc.)
6.	Human-Computer Interfaces
7.	Interaction and Design Concepts
